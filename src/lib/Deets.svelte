		<summary><h2>Questions I'm asking:</h2></summary>

		<ul>
			<li>
				How can we design our technologies to bring out the best in ourselves? What roles can and
				should technology play to improve our communication and relationships, health and wellbeing,
				and social and physical ecologies? Are we building towards a more just world? Do our systems
				make us more responsible for negative externalities? How can we ensure our efforts reduce
				inequalities and increase agency? What are our blind spots, and what perspectives are we
				missing and minimizing? What else do we need to realize more of technology's liberatory
				potential? What are the ripe opportunities and low hanging fruit?
			</li>
			<li>
				What are the interesting and useful frontiers of digital mediums? What fun creative tools
				can we make? How can we include more people in designing, making, and sharing the building
				blocks of digital mediums? How can we make software systems that afford programming powers
				in everyday life for nontechnical and quasitechnical people? How can we further leverage the
				capabilities of the web and our devices? Where is the web going and where should we
				contribute our time and attention?
			</li>
			<li>
				How can we grow sustainable and ever-evolving institutions to protect the things we care
				about? How can we structure and develop organizations to achieve better coordinated outcomes
				while supporting individual agency and autonomy? How can we build robust trusted networks?
				How can we build social systems that encourage inclusive and productive debate? What forms
				of participation work for the majority of us that aren't highly motivated? How can we all be
				better informed with minimal effort? What tools can we design to improve collective decision
				making and shared understanding? How can we make power dynamics in groups more explicit?
				What does it mean for democratic community governance to have desirable dynamics around
				labor and power? In what ways can we practice low-stakes democracy so we're better at it
				when the stakes are higher?
			</li>
			<li>
				How can we balance the needs of individuals and groups? When needs come into conflict, can
				we find creative positive-sum solutions? Like, how can we all just get along and have nice
				things? How can we design technology that respects and reinforces our personal consent
				boundaries? How can we make social contracts more explicit and innovate new ones? Is our
				technology working for our personal and collective benefit? If sometimes not, why not, and
				how can we fix it? What false stories and invisible assumptions are blocking our
				imaginations?
			</li>
			<li>
				What modes of cooperation are available to us where participation is positive sum,
				nonfinancialized, and intrinsically motivated? Which open source communities are thriving,
				and where is there room for improvement? How can we get more of them? Who is being
				systemically excluded from participating, and what are the best remedies? What are some
				optimistic visions of a vibrant and benevolent commons? How can we make our communities and
				worlds more safe, welcoming, kind, fair, joyful, and adventuresome?
			</li>
