	Welcome <span style="font-size: var(--font_size_xl5)">üê¢</span>

<p>
	hello web surfer! You've reached the web site of Ryan Atkinson. He's an open source web developer
	interested in collaborative digital mediums and realizing more of their potential to help us live
	well.
</p>

<p>
	My main skill is coding frontend web apps, and I know enough backend and database stuff to make
	frontends happen. I enjoy trying to make powerful tools that are easy to use, and I have a geeky
	interest in user interfaces and social systems.

	<li>large scale groups with scalable interactivity</li>
	<li>being intentional about the systems and games we want</li>
	<li>the intersections of the above^^</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions I'm asking:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		What roles can and should technology play to improve our communication and relationships, health
		and wellbeing, and social and physical ecologies? Are we building towards a more just world? Do
		our systems make us more responsible for negative externalities? How can we ensure our efforts
		reduce inequalities and increase agency? What are our blind spots, and what perspectives are we
		missing and minimizing? What else do we need to realize more of technology's liberatory
		potential? What are the ripe opportunities and low hanging fruit?
	</li>
	<li>
		What are the interesting and useful frontiers of digital mediums? What fun creative tools can we
		make? How can we include more people in designing, making, and sharing the building blocks of
		digital mediums? How can we make software systems that afford programming powers in everyday
		life for nontechnical and quasitechnical people? How can we further leverage the capabilities of
		the web and our devices? Where is the web going and where should we contribute our time and
		attention?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we grow sustainable and ever-evolving institutions to protect the things we care about?
		How can we structure and develop organizations to achieve better outcomes while supporting
		individual agency and autonomy? How can we build robust trusted networks? What forms of
		participation work for the majority of us that aren't highly motivated? How can we all be better
		informed with minimal effort? What tools can we design to improve collective decision making and
		shared understanding? How can we make power dynamics in groups more explicit? What does it mean
		for democratic community governance to have desirable dynamics around labor and power? In what
		ways can we practice low-stakes democracy so we're better at it when the stakes are higher?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we balance the needs of individuals and groups? When needs come into conflict, can we
		find creative positive-sum solutions? Like, how can we all just get along? How can we design
		technology that respects and reinforces our personal consent boundaries? How can we make social
		contracts more explicit and innovate new ones? Is our technology working for our personal and
		collective benefit? If sometimes not, why not, and how can we fix it? What false stories and
		invisible assumptions are blocking our imaginations?
	</li>
	<li>
		What modes of cooperation are available to us where participation is positive sum,
		nonfinancialized, and intrinsically motivated? Which open source communities are thriving, and
		where is there room for improvement? How can we get more of them? Who is being systemically
		excluded from participating, and what are the best remedies? What are some optimistic visions of
		a vibrant and benevolent commons? How can we make our communities and worlds more safe,
		welcoming, kind, fair, fun, and fruitful?
	</li>
