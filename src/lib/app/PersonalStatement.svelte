<h2>
	Welcome <span style="font-size: var(--font_size_xl5)">üê¢</span>
</h2>
<p>
	Ryan Atkinson is a web developer interested in exploring collaborative digital mediums and
	realizing more of their potential to help us live well.
</p>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>This webpage has two main purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>convey my work persona like a r√©sum√© or CV</li>
	<li>fish for possible collaborations</li>
</ol>

<h2>Seeking collaborations:</h2>

<p>
	I'm always looking for noncommercial collaborations around topics and projects that interest me.
	Want to geek out? Reach out~~! I can't promise a response but I'll do my best:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		email me at <a href="mailto:mail@ryanatkn.com">mail@ryanatkn.com</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		join me in the open source on <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">GitHub</a>, like the
		<a href="https://github.com/spiderspace/spiderspace/discussions">spiderspace discussions</a> or
		<a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/cosmicplayground">cosmicplayground</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		public social media on <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanatkn">Twitter</a>
		<small>(TODO and Mastodon/Matrix?)</small>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Collaborations can take many forms in many different spaces, public and private, and I'm open to
	all of the noncommercial variety. I work at <a href="https://felt.social">@feltcoop</a>, a
	commercial <a href="https://platform.coop">platform co-op</a>, mostly on open source software; I
	don't mind if you commercialize open source if that's your thing, but please no solicitations.
</p>

<p>
	If you read this document and a potential collab springs to mind, I would enjoy hearing about it,
	and if it's something in the open source, don't make me a gatekeeper, go do! Some of my public
	collaborations include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">my GitHub repos</a> which are mostly web apps</li>
	<li>
		the Felt.dev <a href="https://www.felt.dev/sketch/onboard/">Consentful Onboarding Sketch</a>
		inspired by and in cooperation with <a href="https://consentful.systems">consentful.systems</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		the
		<a href="https://github.com/spiderspace/spiderspace/discussions">spiderspace discussions</a>
		for web tech prototypes
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.cosmicplayground.org">cosmicplayground.org</a> for coding and refactoring a
		web app with
		<a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>, and
		TypeScript
	</li>
</ul>

<p>But why collaborate with me?</p>

<ul>
	<li>some really fun/cool/useful/important things are possible only in groups</li>
	<li>you don't have all the answers and skills but you have some</li>
	<li>
		you prefer open source and research-oriented collabs over commercial and investor-backed ones
	</li>
	<li>you like the idea of practicing democratic ownership and control</li>
	<li>I appear to be a colleague you could vibe with</li>
	<li>
		Mozilla says: <em
			>"The collective endowment of an exponentially growing, decentralized, global super-network
			will always vastly exceed anything that can be created without it."</em
		>
	</li>
	<li>idk lol, do what u want, be free~</li>
</ul>

This is my public work persona. I publish code and this website using my IRL legal name, but that's
a choice that's not right for everyone. If we collaborate, know that you can limit your public
exposure and control how you're credited; you can use your legal name, a pseudonym, or even ghost
along anonymously.

<h2>I'm curious about:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>creative tools</li>
	<li>community environments</li>
	<li>participatory governance</li>
	<li>distributed power</li>
	<li>consentful design</li>
	<li>being intentional about the systems and games we want</li>
	<li>the intersections of the above^^</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions I'm asking:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		How can technology improve our lives and ecologies? What roles should technology play to improve
		our thinking, communication, health, and social environments? What else do we need to realize
		more of technology's liberatory potential?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we design technology that respects and reinforces our personal consent boundaries?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we include more people in designing, making, and sharing the building blocks of digital
		mediums? How can we make software systems that afford programming powers in everyone's everyday
		life? How far can we run with the web? How can we further leverage the web's capabilities?
	</li>
	<li>
		What modes of cooperation are available to us in the various meaningful aspects of our lives?
		How can technology help? How can we build robust trusted networks? How can we make power
		dynamics in groups more explicit?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we play better games together? Examples? What are the lessons and how can we apply them
		throughout everyday life? How can we make our worlds more safe, fair, and fun?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we implement things to realize our goals? In other words, what actions should we take?
		Make apps? Curate datasets? Publish research? Blogs? Create audio and video content? Which
		mediums do we want to work in and why?
	</li>
</ul>
