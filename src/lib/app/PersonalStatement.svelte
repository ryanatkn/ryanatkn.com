<h2>
	Welcome <span style="font-size: var(--font_size_xl5)">🐢</span>
</h2>
<p>
	I'm Ryan Atkinson, a web developer interested in collaborative digital mediums and realizing more
	of their potential to help us live well.
</p>

<p>
	My main skill is coding frontend web apps, and I know enough backend and database stuff to make
	frontends happen. I enjoy trying to make powerful tools that are easy to use, and I have a geeky
	interest in user interfaces and social systems.

<h2>I'm curious about:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>creative tools</li>
	<li>community environments</li>
	<li>crowd wisdom</li>
	<li>participatory governance</li>
	<li>distributed power</li>
	<li>consentful design</li>
	<li>networked trust and safety</li>
	<li>being intentional about the systems and games we want</li>
	<li>the intersections of the above^^</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions I'm asking:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		How can technology improve our lives and ecologies? What roles should technology play to improve
		our thinking, communication, health, and social environments? What are the big opportunities and
		low hanging fruit? What else do we need to realize more of technology's liberatory potential?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we design technology that respects and reinforces our personal consent boundaries?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we include more people in designing, making, and sharing the building blocks of digital
		mediums? How can we make software systems that afford programming powers in everyone's everyday
		life? And where power is working for our collective and individual benefit? How can we further
		leverage the web's existing capabilities? Where is the web going and how far can we run with it?
	</li>
	<li>
		What modes of cooperation are available to us in the various meaningful aspects of our lives?
		How can we structure and develop organizations to achieve better outcomes? How can we grow
		institutions that support individual agency and autonomy? How can technology help? How can we
		build trusted networks? And sustain them? How can we design tools to improve collective decision
		making and shared understanding? How can we make power dynamics in groups more explicit? How can
		we support democratic community governance with more desirable dynamics around labor and power?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can we support social systems where participation is positive sum, nonfinancialized, and
		intrinsically motivated? Which open source communities are thriving, and where is there room for
		improvement? Who is being systematically excluded from participating, and what are the best
		remedies? What are some optimistic visions of a robust and benevolent commons? How can we make
		our communities and worlds more safe, welcoming, fair, fun, and useful?
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fishing for collaborations:</h2>

<p>
	I'm always looking for noncommercial collaborations around topics and projects that interest me.

	response but I'll do my best. Some of my public collaborations include:
