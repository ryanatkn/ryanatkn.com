<p>
	this idea has been going around a lot lately with recent advancements in #ai and it's not a big
	leap from where we are today: imagine a social media app where you get lots of likes and replies
	to your stuff but it's almost all bots designed to monetize your attention
</p>

<p>imagine that it's _you and your loved ones_ stuck in that matrix without knowing it</p>

<p>
	humanity and trust matter more than ever, and our culture and tools need to catch up

</p>

<p>"humanity and trust matter more than ever"</p>

<p>
	hm does it actually matter more today than in the past? maybe ya kinda? thinking about the tight
	knit groups of about {$dunbars_number} (yes I made the reference lol) tribespeople we evolved in, and
	how detached I/family/friends are from that tribal mutual aid oxytocin cocktail, in our modern hyperconnected
	hyperaliented hyperworld
</p>

<p>
	my mind just panics and blurts out "free and open source software and data" and then
	thought-terminatingly, "governance" Jan 10, 2023, 22:23 · · 0 · 0 1h ryanatkn@hci.social Ryan

<p>
	the thing is with that cocktail, tmaoc, it's not hard to be a good person, just don't be fucked up
	and you can function as a happy tribe when times are good, if you have a culture that enforces
	accountability for behavior, hopefully with positive psychology and good vibes
</p>

<p>
	we couldn't possibly have evolved with the dysfunctional societal relationships we see dominate
	the planet today
</p>

<p>scale did us in</p>

<p>
	we could intentionally form groups at every scale, then #interconnect#interoperate#interdepend#

<p>and when bad times?</p>
<p>ChatGPT continues:</p>

<p>
	But even in bad times, there is always hope. We can always find ways to come together and support
	one another, to find strength in our shared humanity and trust. It may not be easy, but together,
	we can rise above any challenges and build a better future for ourselves and those we love. So let
	us not give in to fear or despair, but instead hold on to hope and kindness, and work towards
	building a world that is truly just and equitable for all. 6m ryanatkn Ryan Atkinson @ryanatkn

<p>the hyperconnected hyperaliented hyperworld aka hhh</p>

<p>(ChatGPT takes over here)</p>

<p>
	is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to connect with people from all over the globe,
	expand our perspectives, and access a wealth of knowledge. But on the other hand, it can lead to
	feelings of isolation, manipulation, and a loss of privacy.
</p>

<p>1/3 4m ryanatkn Ryan Atkinson @ryanatkn</p>

<p>@ryanatkn@hci.social</p>

<p>ChatGPT continues:</p>

<p>
	To counter this, we need to actively work on building trust and creating a sense of community
	within our online interactions. This means not only being mindful of our own behavior and the way
	we treat others, but also supporting open-source and transparent technologies that give us control
	over our data and online presence.
</p>

<p>ChatGPT concludes:</p>

<p>
	It also means actively working towards forming interdependent and interconnected communities,
	rather than relying on a centralized authority to govern us. By coming together, we can create a
	new culture and set of tools that prioritize humanity and trust over profit and manipulation.
	Let's strive to make the hhh a place where we can all thrive.
