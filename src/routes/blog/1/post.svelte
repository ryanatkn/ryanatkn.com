		I've been making free and open source web community software with
		<a href="https://12mod12.com/">Hamilton Reed</a> full-time
		<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server/graphs/contributors">since April 2021</a>. (he's
		@greatbacon on <a href="https://github.com/greatbacon">GitHub</a> and
		<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@greatbacon">Mastodon</a>) We've been working quietly in public
		and leaving a trail of informal documentation through
		<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server/pulls">GitHub PRs</a>. We'll announce when we
		reach alpha in Q3 2023.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hamilton and I first met in December 2019 and started self-funded part-time work on what would
		become <a href="https://github.com/feltjs">@feltjs</a>. One of the main ideas was to make tools
		to help people be creative together - visit <a href="https://www.felt.dev/">felt.dev</a> to see where
		we are.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our main project is <a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server">felt-server</a>, an
		extensible Node.js server and web frontend described as "a programmable platform for hobbyists
		and human-scale communities". The main UI looks like Discord and Slack on the surface, and it
		has aspects of a
		<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management system</a>
		and
		<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management_software"
			>knowledge management software</a
		> in a collaborative environment. We're aiming for a batteries-included, deeply customizable experience
		with a small footprint, that feels familiar and surprisingly powerful. Calling it a "programmable
		platform" is the best we have right now.
	</p>
	<p>
		felt-server targets a specific UX. Instead of trying to replace any of today's large platforms,
		we think of felt-server as filling a niche that venture-funded startups and other commercial
		interests rationally ignore.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			it's made by and for devs, students, hobbyists, selfhosters, tinkerers, techies, lazy
			automation-enjoyers - it should give you all the control you want, be broadly useful, and
			remain a relatively simple project that's easy and cheap to self-host
		</li>
		<li>
			designed for small groups - scaling to thousands of people is less important for feltjs than
			the depth of interaction and richness of capabilities
		</li>
		<li>
			multipurpose, extensible, and interoperable, so the same toolkit can be used for many kinds of
			communities and websites and problems - felt-server can run some of your friendly bots in the
			clouds with a nice web GUI
		</li>
		<li>
			is free and open source with a documented API, and it's designed for fullstack customization,
			which means devs and end-users have proper access and power over their UX and systems and
			code, and we bridge more of the gap between programming and using
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Fullstack customization is part of the point of feltjs, but today it's a vague idea with some
		interesting glimmers scattered around. The point is to help us solve problems, which are unknown
		and numerous, so we design the system holistcally with that in mind - the UX is the DX is the
		UX. It's confusing but so is the problem of solving so many problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		For devs, this means we'll have open source servers, clients, and modules that are designed to
		be extended and plugged and swapped. It also means our programming vocabulary is exposed in the
		UX, so the system itself is more visible and directly interactive, blurring lines between the
		experiences of devs and end-users.
	</p>
	<p>For end-users it means:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			a comfortable environment that looks like existing social apps, but when you go digging you
			find it's deeply customizable and flexible, and now it makes sense that people say all these
			seemingly different web experiences were "made with feltjs" and maybe you could use it to make
			that thing?
		</li>
		<li>
			a user-friendly text language - like Slack and Discord it'll be similar to Markdown - with
			access to a rich vocabulary that can be used to write chat messages, blog posts, forum
			replies, todo items, and so on, and also construct both social spaces and the entire client
			UI, forming the base of an accessible experience to design and share UI
		</li>
		<li>
			easy-to-use plugins/mods/applets made by both feltjs and hopefully a community of
			developer-users, with clear paths to learning the technical skills to make your own stuff -
			making an idea with code should be reduced to the essentials, so you incur no complexity
			beyond what's needed
		</li>
		<li>
			integration of low-level systems with high-level UX, so power users can go deep - things like
			integrated interactive documentation, a contextmenu UI pattern that enables direct interaction
			with everything you see, and recording events and authoring scripts and then composing them,
			like with governance processes (e.g. "execute this script if the vote passes")
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Instead of being limited to filling digital boxes designed by tech companies, we could be
		designing own boxes for our unique situations and sharing the patterns with each other. I want
		the act of creating tools and sharing them to be a normal part of the software-using experience.
		One of the ways I think about feltjs is that it's a layer that sits between SvelteKit and your
		app, that's trying to do as much of the uninteresting parts as possible. You're the person with
		ideas, the tools should be enabling and out of the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		felt-server will support simple and scalable static web publishing like blogs and RSS/Atom
		feeds, and also provide tools to make realtime social experiences and games that inherit your
		social context, enabling beginners to participate in the creative process more easily. Doing a
		hard thing is much easier when the task is reduced to its essentials.
	</p>
	<p>We have a handful of software repos:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server">@feltjs/felt-server</a> ‚Äì a programmable platform
			for hobbyists and human-scale communities, the Node.js server that's selfhostable and available
			as a library on npm
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-ui">@feltjs/felt-ui</a> ‚Äì styles and UI components for
			Svelte and SvelteKit üíö
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-template">@feltjs/felt-template</a> ‚Äì a static web app
			template with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Felt for quickly creating new projects - in the future
			it will support quickly creating a custom server project, too.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/util">@feltjs/util</a> ‚Äì JS utilities to complement the modern
			web platform ü¶ïüêã
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/gro">@feltjs/gro</a> ‚Äì a toolkit that extends SvelteKit and
			Vite with things we find useful for making web apps - it's used by all of our other projects
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		With feltjs, I hope we can make the role of toolmaker more accessible to more people on the web,
		to help us bring ideas to life while supporting beneficial relationships with technology. I like
		feltjs' combination of solid technical foundations, lightweight implementation, and DIY
		hackability. It's been fun and there's cooler stuff ahead.

	<h2>P.S.</h2>
	<p>
		I'm having difficulty summarizing the project, it's big and there are many unknowns. The ideas
		below seem important to include but not that important, and you may not be the right audience.
		Thanks for reading.
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Business and ownership</h2>
	<p>
		We haven't done the legal work to make it official, but the feltjs trademarks and domains, like <a
			href="/felt.png">the green heart logo</a
		>
		and
		<a href="https://www.felt.dev/">felt.dev</a>, will be owned and managed by some kind of
		nonprofit entity. This is a commitment to the public open source community that these are
		community assets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Originally I thought I was going to operate a hosting company, <a
			href="https://www.felt.social/">felt.social</a
		>, so we could earn money and make software sustainably. The logic is air-tight - we're making
		selfhostable software, but not everyone wants to self-host, so we offer it for a fee, do what we
		love, and make open source sustainable, all in one move.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two problems: we won't get the best software if a hosting company has too much influence over
		its development, and also, I now accept a fact about myself, that I don't love operations.
		Instead I want to spend my time making software, and I'll gladly pay money to people who enjoy
		operations in exchange for a simpler life. Opening myself to being responsible for commercial
		hosting - with moderation, security, downtime, abuse, legal, international, even the basic admin
		- feels overwhelming. I think the value I add working directly on the software is high enough
		that I don't need to put this other huge scary world on my plate, and I think the software will
		be better if it gets my focus.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted to be the person who does both the software and the hosting business too, but I m not,
		and for the people who do it, my hat off and wallet out. My sustainability plan has to pivot to
		adjust to reality. Hamilton may continue pursuing <a href="https://www.felt.social/"
			>felt.social</a
		> as a cooperatively-owned host, he'll just need 4 cofounders instead of 3 to officially start the
		co-op in Colorado. Please take my money!!
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h2>Sharing spaces with others</h2>
	<p>
		One aspect of community software that's full of interesting opportunities is how to govern
		shared spaces - things like exercising power, communicating and enforcing rules, nudging norms,
		making collective decisions, scripting governance processes over time, and so on. Each group of
		people has distinct needs. I wrote about modeling social spaces in <a
			href="{base}/blog/modeling-virtual-social-spaces-in-this-house-we-post-cat-pics-on-saturday"
			>my second blog post</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For part of 2021 and 2022 Hamilton and I collaborated with PhD candidate Jane Im (<a
			href="https://imjane.net/">imjane.net</a
		>) on designs related to research-backed user-driven governance. Her paper "Yes: Affirmative
		Consent as a Theoretical Framework for Understanding and Imagining Social Platforms" (<a
			href="https://consentful.systems/">consentful.systems</a
		>), which credits <a href="https://www.consentfultech.io/">The Consentful Tech Project</a>, has
		been a major source of inspiration for how we think about designing software, and motivated our
		<a href="https://ui.felt.dev/sketch/onboard">Consentful Onboarding Sketch</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our perspective as toolmakers is that we'll attempt to support all the things people want to do,
		from traditional moderator setups to democratic control and much more, and provide templates and
		guidance to help communities achieve their goals. We'll give this a lot of attention before
		beta, but I suspect the good stuff is years away, maybe using standards that
		<a href="https://metagov.org/">Metagov</a> is developing. I'm also following related projects
		<a href="https://communityrule.info/">CommunityRule</a>
		and <a href="https://policykit.org/">PolicyKit</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Tech notes</h2>
	<p>
		We tried to be thoughtful about our tech stack to be friendly to beginners without compromising
		on the delivered UX.
	</p>
	<h3>on the shoulders of giants on the backs of turtles</h3>
	<p>
		We chose the web because we think it's the best way to deliver the UX we want to the most
		people, and we chose JS, Node.js, and npm because of fit, familiarity, and productivity. The web
		is everywhere and has a lot of unrealized potential. In combination, Node.js, Postgres, nginx,
		and Linux are all productive and capable of delivering a good UX. TypeScript, Svelte, SvelteKit,
		and Vite are excellent for making robust and snappy UIs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our server-side code is written for Node.js today, but we should be able to offer significant
		runtime flexibility in the long term, largely thanks to <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
			>SvelteKit</a
		>, so you may choose Deno, Bun, a cloud platform's serverless offerings, or whatever else is in
		the Node.js legacy compat space. We're trying to minimize our exposure to Node-specific APIs to
		keep portability high. Node.js a practical choice, not an idealized one. (and we try to move
		forward - for example feltjs never used any CommonJS)
	</p>
	<h3>customizable and extensible</h3>
	<p>
		Both the server and clients are open source and our APIs are open, so clients can be modified
		with low friction or created from scratch. (our client will be decoupled from the server during
		alpha, stay tuned) We use TypeScript and Svelte across the full stack, and we try to leverage
		the benefits of integration when available, like sharing types, helpers, and schemas. We try to
		maximize the freedoms and degrees of freedom enjoyed by our users and developers, but security
		and performance are unfortunate constraints and sometimes buzzkills :\
	</p>
	<p>
		Our client has a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)#Thick">thickness</a>
		optimized for a powerful and low-latency UX over long sessions, which means a lot of JS and client-side
		caching, and thanks to SvelteKit we should be able to deliver good experiences in many cases with
		fast loadtimes and minimal or zero JS. (but we're
		<a
			href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server/blob/main/src/docs/known-issues.md#not-using-sveltekits-server-side-data-loading"
			>not there yet</a
		>)
	</p>
	<h3>scaling (and not)</h3>
	<p>
		Our focus on "small communities" relates to a potentially deflating fact about our software - it
		doesn't scale to large numbers of people or some kinds of heavy load. felt-server can't be the
		best solution to all problems, so we make tradeoffs intentionally to serve a particular UX.
	</p>
	<div>We're optimizing to:</div>
	<ul>
		<li>quickly iterate on social experiences with human-scale groups of people</li>
		<li>
			on a single machine, running a server and local database with light resource requirements
		</li>
		<li>with web tech, putting us in a particular ecosystem of software</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The limits may appear restrictive compared to the infinite cloud worlds that can host a global
		social network, but these choices give us a highly productive environment with low resource
		usage that's friendly to beginners. We're trying to be powerful in the small, and maybe small
		communities are good too.
	</p>
	<aside>
		Today, <a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server"><code>@feltjs/felt-server</code></a>
		supports only
		<code
			><a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-node"
				>@sveltejs/adapter-node</a
			></code
		> ‚Äì we'd like to be compatible with as many SvelteKit adapters as possible, giving operators access
		to more scalable cloud backends, but we haven't worked it into our roadmap.
	</aside>
	<p>
		We should be able to support non-realtime usecases that scale to more users like blogs and
		similar web publishing, much for free thanks to SvelteKit. We're prioritizing flexibility and UX
		over the ability to handle massive numbers of concurrent users or big data, and we'll improve
		various kinds of scaling over time.
	</p>
	<h3 id="interop">interop and decentralization</h3>
	<p>
		I value giving users choices, and that includes <a
			href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability"
			>cooperative interoperability</a
		>, but we're a 2 person team with limited resources trying to deliver a specific UX. Today this
		means we have a centralized Node server with a lot of homemade solutions. One of my medium-long
		term goals is to support at least one federated/decentralized standard like
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> or Matrix.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our data system, we're following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/"
			>the ActivityStreams vocabulary spec</a
		>
		that's used in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> and
		<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>
		(and I made some
		<a href="https://ryanatkn.github.io/corpus-activity-streams/">unofficial docs</a>), but we have
		our own client-server protocol that works over RESTful http and websockets using
		<a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">JSON-RPC 2.0</a>. We also publish a
		<a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>
		with
		<a href="https://github.com/feltjs/felt-server/blob/main/src/static/schemas/vocab.json"
			>our vocabulary</a
		>, including both data objects and actions. We could feasibly generate OpenAPI schemas from our
		source of truth, giving us greatly expanded access to existing tooling, but we have no plans for
		that yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		We want to be good citizens of open standards, not just do our own thing detached from open
		ecosystems, but we have very specific ideas of what we want to build for small communities, and
		federated tech isn't optimal for today's goals. (if you link me xkcd 927 i swear)
	</p>
	<p>
		Given felt-server's small-scale design and selfhostability, it may help to think of it as "<a
			href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycentric">polycentric</a
		>", where each community or "hub" is a silo of self-governed data, and any particular instance
		hosts one or more hubs. In combination with clients that connect to multiple services, I think
		"decentralized" is an appropriate description, but not in the way some people want, for example
		where their identity isn't mediated by the hub. I don't think felt-server will reach its
		potential until it can federate with the wider world, especially for user identity.
	</p>
	<aside>
		I don't know which standards will or should win with identity, that's outside of my expertise,
		but I have to make decisions for users, and I'm currently planning on supporting <a
			href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)">OpenID Connect</a
		>
		(OIDC) to complement our current password-in-a-cookie authentication. I like how the
		<a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a> uses domains for identity - compared to ActivityPub
		identities, they offer better portability and stability. Together with subdomains, I like the combination
		of user-friendliness, flexibility, aesthetics, and DNS-derived authority.
	</aside>
	<p>
		I personally think decentralized technologies are the future and I want to move with the times.
		In any case, we need user interfaces that are decoupled from the underlying protocols, and
		feltjs wants to be as repurposable as it can be.
	</p>
	<aside>
		"decentralized" means a lot of things, and while I think it's a broadly inevitable future, I
		believe the rather important details of ownership and power have yet to be determined, and my
		hope is that justice-oriented movements like <a href="https://platform.coop/"
			>platform cooperatives</a
		>
		and <a href="https://getdweb.net/principles/">the DWeb</a>
		do better than the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a> and
		financializing that dominates today - I want to own (or at least co-own) the digital ground
		under my own feet, don't you<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">?</a>
