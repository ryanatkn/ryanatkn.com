I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you enjoy my output and want more of it, a
				donation of any amount is helpful in two ways, 1) because money buys me time, and 2) because
				it's a strong signal that boosts my case for getting more funding, from both users like you
				and maybe grants or a job that uses or sponsors my open source work.</p> <p>I'm working on several projects, but the main one is <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a>, a fullstack web toolkit focused on user power and experimentation. It can be used (still
				a work in progress) to browse and create for the web with an open-ended nice-to-use tool,
				and to build websites and apps, both for regular desktop app users and for devs with
				existing workflows. It values security and interoperability, and idealizes an integrated
				system leveraging universal JS.</p> <p>I want to make software with the best UX possible, and as widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> suggests, I think
				that's infinitely easier to do when unburdened by investors and profit-seeking. I'm self-funded,
				so the situation is uncomplicated -- trust me or not. I'm not going to sell control over Zzz
				and its dependencies or take investment for them. The goal is software designed for our benefit
				that we can trust to serve us. If a user community forms around some projects in my stack, I
				think the best outcome is them being owned by a community-representing org like a nonprofit.</p> <p>I like my independence and I think it allows me to make software with a different set of
				values from the norm. I hope to make it sustainable without compromising my autonomy.</p></div></section> <section class="box row flex_wrap_wrap gap_md"><div class="display_contents"><!></div> <!></section> <section class="panel p_sm shadow_md width_100"><div class="panel bg p_xl shadow_xs"><p>Today my attention is on these projects, parts of a stack I plan to use to make other
				websites and apps:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> - fullstack toolkit for adaptive web environments</li> <li><a href="https://moss.ryanatkn.com/">Moss</a> - CSS framework and design system</li> <li><a href="https://www.fuz.dev/">Fuz</a> - Svelte UI library</li> <li><a href="https://gro.ryanatkn.com/">Gro</a> - task runner and toolkit extending SvelteKit</li></ul> <p>More on my <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">GitHub profile</a> and <a href="https://www.ryanatkn.com/tree">website</a>. I'm also communicating about my
				projects and process with <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/">webdevladder.net</a>, and
				I shared more plans in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p> <p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it. I program both as a profession and hobby, and I love the web
				for its global accessibility, high capability, backwards compatibility, and gatekeeper
				optionality. In 2019 I started publishing most of my code as I wrote it, and set out to
				produce high quality and reusable software with TypeScript and Svelte, working full-time in
				public and continuing today. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>Donating $1 a month on <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> and <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a> helps me a lot for the signal it sends. No rewards yet but idk.</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to find collaborators around
				these ideas and technologies as I work in public. See the <a>repos</a> for more.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function he(v,s){K(s,!0);var i=ae(),d=e(i),h=e(d),m=e(h),r=a(e(m),2);I(r,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),t(m),t(h),t(d);var p=a(d,4),l=e(p);I(l,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var b=e(l);M(b,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",attrs:{style:"max-width: 100%"},icon:o=>{H(o,{get data(){return L},fill:"var(--color_b_5)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(o,A)=>{n();var x=$("GitHub Sponsors");w(o,x)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(l);var F=a(l,2);M(F,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:o=>{T(o,{fill:"var(--color_a_5)"})},children:(o,A)=>{n();var x=$("Patreon");w(o,x)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(p);var _=a(p,2),S=e(_),g=a(e(S),6),Z=a(e(g));n(),t(g);var y=a(g,2),f=a(e(y));I(f,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var E=e(f);H(E,{get data(){return L},size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_5)",inline:!0}),n(),t(f);var P=a(f,2),J=e(P);T(J,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_5)",inline:!0}),n(),t(P),n(),t(y);var j=a(y,2),U=a(e(j));n(),t(j),t(S),t(_);var k=a(_,2),X=e(k);O(X,{}),t(k);var C=a(k,2),q=e(C);V(q,{children:(c,o)=>{ee(c,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),t(C),t(i),B((c,o)=>{z(Z,"href",c),z(U,"href",o)},[()=>G("/about"),()=>G("/tree")]),w(v,i),Q()}export{he as component};
