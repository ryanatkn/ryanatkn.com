I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you enjoy my output and want more of it, a
				donation of any amount is helpful in two ways, 1) because money buys me time, and 2) because
				it's a strong signal that boosts my case for getting more funding, from both users like you
				and maybe grants or a job that sponsors some of my open source work.</p> <p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it. I program both as a profession and hobby, and I love the web
				for its global accessibility, high capability, backwards compatibility, and gatekeeper
				optionality. In 2019 I started publishing most of my code as I wrote it, and set out to
				produce high quality and reusable software with TypeScript and Svelte, working full-time in
				public and continuing today. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>I'm working on several projects, but the main one is <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a>, a fullstack web toolkit focused on user power and experimentation. It can be used (still
				a work in progress) to build websites and apps, both for regular desktop app users and for
				devs with existing workflows. It values interoperability and idealizes an integrated system
				leveraging universal JS.</p> <p>I want to make software with the best UX possible, and as widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> suggests, I think
				that's infinitely easier to do when unburdened by investors and profit-seeking. I'm self-funded,
				so the situation is uncomplicated -- trust me or not. I'm not going to sell control over Zzz
				and its dependencies or take investment for them. The goal is software designed for our benefit
				that we can trust to serve us. If a user community forms around some projects in my stack, I
				think the best outcome is them being owned by a community-representing org like a nonprofit.</p> <p>I like my independence and I think it serves my software well, but my current situation is
				not ideal. I miss working on a team, having organizational support, and receiving a
				paycheck. However, having many smaller sponsors would free me from the influence of large
				sponsors, and maybe some volunteers will want to collaborate. I don't know, so I'm following
				multiple funding paths including seeking grant funding, and I'm open to joining a company
				that wants to see <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> succeed as a noncommercial independent software project. Right now I'm not looking for full-time
				work unless it's related to Zzz (for example I can build tools and websites with it <small>(<em>with ai!! tell ur boss</em>)</small>). Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fti-__uwjazBllAqR73wrQ1lG6QO0ECBpz4n7XENP0Y/edit?usp=sharing">my resume</a>.</p></div></section> <section class="box row flex_wrap gap_md"><div class="display_contents"><!></div> <!></section> <section class="panel p_sm shadow_md w_100"><div class="panel bg p_xl shadow_xs"><p>Today my attention is on these projects -- I plan to make websites and apps with them:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> - fullstack toolkit for adaptive web environments</li> <li><a href="https://moss.ryanatkn.com/">Moss</a> - CSS framework and design system</li> <li><a href="https://www.fuz.dev/">Fuz</a> - Svelte UI library</li> <li><a href="https://gro.ryanatkn.com/">Gro</a> - task runner and toolkit extending SvelteKit</li></ul> <p>More on my <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">GitHub profile</a> and <a href="https://www.ryanatkn.com/tree">website</a>. I'm also communicating about my

				I shared more plans in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p> <p>To help me produce software, videos, and blog posts, you can support me on <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> or <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a>. Supporting me at even $1/mo helps a lot for the signal it sends, and will grant you
				access to supporters-only social websites I build on camera (maybe late 2025 or 2026).</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to find collaborators around
				these ideas and technologies as I work in public. See the repos for the details and
				discussions.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function de(w){var o=V(),r=e(o),d=e(r),p=e(d),v=a(e(p),2);z(v,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),t(p),t(d),t(r);var s=a(r,2),l=e(s),c=a(e(l),4),g=a(e(c));T(g,"href",`${K??""}/about`),i(),t(c),i(6),t(l),t(s);var b=a(s,2),m=e(b);z(m,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var Z=e(m);B(Z,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",attrs:{style:"max-width: 100%"},icon:n=>{$(n,{data:H,fill:"var(--color_b_5)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(n,q)=>{i();var I=C("GitHub Sponsors");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(m);var E=a(m,2);B(E,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:n=>{G(n,{fill:"var(--color_a_5)"})},children:(n,q)=>{i();var I=C("Patreon");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(b);var _=a(b,2),x=e(_),S=a(e(x),6),h=a(e(S));z(h,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var F=e(h);$(F,{data:H,size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_5)",inline:!0}),i(),t(h);var j=a(h,2),L=e(j);G(L,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_5)",inline:!0}),i(),t(j),i(),t(S),i(2),t(x),t(_);var y=a(_,2),M=e(y);N(M,{}),t(y);var P=a(y,2),X=e(P);O(X,{children:(k,n)=>{W(k,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),t(P),t(o),f(w,o)}export{de as component};
