I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you enjoy my output and want more of it, a
				donation of any amount is helpful in two ways, 1) because money buys me time, and 2) because
				it's a strong signal that boosts my case for getting more funding, from both users like you
				and maybe grants or a job that sponsors some of my open source work.</p> <p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it. I program both as a profession and hobby, and I love the web
				for its global accessibility, high capability, backwards compatibility, and gatekeeper
				optionality. In 2019 I started publishing most of my code as I wrote it, and set out to
				produce high quality and reusable software with TypeScript and Svelte, working full-time in
				public and continuing today. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>I'm working on several projects, but the main one is <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a>, a fullstack web toolkit focused on user power and experimentation. It can be used (still
				a work in progress) to build websites and apps, both for regular desktop app users and for
				devs with existing workflows. It values interoperability and idealizes an integrated system
				leveraging universal JS.</p> <p>I want to make software with the best UX possible, and I think that's infinitely easier to
				do when unburdened by investors and profit-seeking, as widespread <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> suggests. I'm self-funded,
				so the situation is uncomplicated -- trust me or not. If a user community forms around some projects
				in my stack, I think success could look like them being owned by a community-representing org
				like a nonprofit, but in the meantime they'll sit on my GitHub, fate tied to mine and MIT licensed.
				I'm not going to sell control over Zzz and its dependencies or take any investment for them.
				The dream is we get to make software that we design for our benefit and trust to serve us, down
				to the structural incentives in its production. I can always continue part-time on Zzz as long
				as the motivation sustains, so far so good.</p> <p>I like my independence and I think it serves the software well, but my current situation is
				not ideal. Having many smaller sponsors would free me from the influence of large sponsors,
				but I miss working on a team, having organizational support, and receiving a paycheck. Maybe
				volunteers will want to collaborate and that will work for me, I don't know. I'm following
				multiple paths including seeking grant funding, and I'm open to joining a company that wants
				to see <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> succeed as a noncommercial independent software project. Right now I'm not looking for full-time
				work unless it's related to Zzz (for example I can build tools and websites with it <small>(<em>with ai!! tell ur boss</em>)</small>). Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fti-__uwjazBllAqR73wrQ1lG6QO0ECBpz4n7XENP0Y/edit?usp=sharing">my resume</a>.</p></div></section> <section class="box row flex_wrap gap_md"><div class="display_contents"><!></div> <!></section> <section class="panel p_sm shadow_md w_100"><div class="panel bg p_xl shadow_xs"><p>Today my attention is on these projects, and I plan to make end-user-facing websites and

I shared more plans in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p> <p>I've been lucky to be able to live off savings for the last 6 years, but I need a funding
				plan to sustain these projects. My runway currently extends through 2026.</p> <p>To help me produce software, videos, and blog posts, you can support me on <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> or <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a>. Supporting me at any level will grant you access to supporters-only social websites I
				build on camera (none yet, maybe late 2025 or 2026, I don't want to spend time moderating so
				expect constrained affordances or maybe I will chase a butterfly elsewhere).</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to collaborate more with people
				around these ideas and technologies.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function de(w){var o=V(),r=e(o),d=e(r),c=e(d),v=a(e(c),2);z(v,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),t(c),t(d),t(r);var s=a(r,2),l=e(s),p=a(e(l),4),b=a(e(p));T(b,"href",`${K??""}/about`),i(),t(p),i(6),t(l),t(s);var g=a(s,2),m=e(g);z(m,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var Z=e(m);G(Z,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",attrs:{style:"max-width: 100%"},icon:n=>{H(n,{data:$,fill:"var(--color_b_5)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(n,q)=>{i();var I=C("GitHub Sponsors");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(m);var B=a(m,2);G(B,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:n=>{M(n,{fill:"var(--color_a_5)"})},children:(n,q)=>{i();var I=C("Patreon");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),t(g);var _=a(g,2),x=e(_),S=a(e(x),8),u=a(e(S));z(u,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var E=e(u);H(E,{data:$,size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_5)",inline:!0}),i(),t(u);var j=a(u,2),F=e(j);M(F,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_5)",inline:!0}),i(),t(j),i(),t(S),i(2),t(x),t(_);var y=a(_,2),L=e(y);N(L,{}),t(y);var P=a(y,2),X=e(P);O(X,{children:(k,n)=>{W(k,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),t(P),t(o),f(w,o)}export{de as component};
