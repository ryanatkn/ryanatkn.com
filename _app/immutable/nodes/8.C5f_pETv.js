I'm trying to make
				powerful and simple tools to help people be creative and productive in social contexts. I'm

				early stages of trying to get <a>funding</a> directly from my users,
				viewers, and readers. I'm also looking for low-hour consulting work â€“ here's my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fti-__uwjazBllAqR73wrQ1lG6QO0ECBpz4n7XENP0Y/edit?usp=sharing">resume</a>.</p> <p>I work on the web because for all its flaws, it's a collectively-governed sandboxed platform
				with backwards compatibility that runs everywhere, reaching more people with less friction
				than anything else. I care a lot about software quality, maintainability, performance, and
				giving power to users throughout the stack.</p></div> <p class="svelte-10efjxi">More:</p> <ul class="svelte-10efjxi"><li>In 2019 I started <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">doing full-time open source</a>,
