I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you enjoy my output and want more of it,
				donations are helpful in two ways, 1) because money buys me time to develop free software,
				and 2) because it's a strong signal that boosts my case for getting more funding, from both
				users like you and maybe grants/sponsorships/fellowships to support my open source work.</p> <aside>Stars on GitHub are also a helpful show of appreciation 💫 <a href="https://github.com/fuzdev">@fuzdev</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">@ryanatkn</a></aside> <p>I'm working on several projects, but the main one is Fuz, "a zippy stack for autonomy", see <a href="https://www.fuz.dev/">fuz.dev</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fuzdev">github.com/fuzdev</a>. It's a set of tools to build
				websites and powerful systems, and direct computers in general. It's built for user control,
				security, and interoperability, and idealizes an integrated system of a particular taste.
				(TypeScript/Svelte/Rust/Postgres/Linux)</p> <p>My plan for Fuz and its related projects is to have them stewarded by some kind of a
				nonprofit, but that would require a community to form first, users using the software.
				Before LLMs I thought a community forming was a likely outcome, but who knows any more!
				¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I think my independence allows me to make software with a different set of values
				from the norm, not a lucrative path but I find it going interesting places. So I like what
				I'm doing and want noncommerical projects like Fuz to exist, but I'm still figuring out how
				to make it sustainable and more collaborative.</p> <p>Today my attention is on these projects, parts of a stack I plan to use to make other
				websites and apps:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> - local-first forge for power users and developers</li> <li><a href="https://css.fuz.dev/">fuz_css</a> - CSS framework and design system</li> <li><a href="https://ui.fuz.dev/">fuz_ui</a> - Svelte UI library</li> <li>several unreleased projects coming soon</li></ul> <p>More on my <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">GitHub profile</a> and <a href="https://www.ryanatkn.com/tree">website</a>. I'm also communicating about my
				projects and process with <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/">webdevladder.net</a>, and
				I shared more plans in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p></div></section> <section class="box row flex-wrap:wrap gap_md"><div class="display:contents"><!></div> <!></section> <section class="panel p_sm shadow_md width:100%"><div class="panel shade_00 p_xl shadow_xs"><p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it, programming both as a profession and hobby. In 2019 I started <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn?tab=overview&amp;from=2019-12-01&amp;to=2019-12-31">publishing most of my code</a> as I wrote it, and set out to produce high quality and reusable software with TypeScript, Svelte,
				and Rust, working full-time in public and continuing today.</p> <p>I love the web for its global accessibility, high capability, backwards compatibility, and
				gatekeeper optionality, and I think the software I'm building for it is shaping up nicely,
				although the scope is really big, and it'll take time to fully realize. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>Donating $1 a month on <a class="white-space:nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> and <a class="white-space:nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a> helps me a lot for the signal it sends. No rewards yet, but one possiblity is donors will get
				access to websites I build on camera, maybe in 2026.</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to find collaborators around
				these ideas and technologies as I work in public. See the <a>repos</a> for the code and discussions.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function fe(v,r){W(r,!0);var n=oe(),d=e(n),c=e(d),u=e(c),b=t(e(u),2);z(b,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),a(u),a(c),a(d);var s=t(d,4),l=e(s);z(l,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_50)"});var G=e(l);H(G,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",style:"max-width: 100%",icon:o=>{L(o,{get data(){return F},fill:"var(--color_b_50)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(o,J)=>{i();var k=j("GitHub Sponsors");m(o,k)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(l);var T=t(l,2);H(T,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:o=>{M(o,{fill:"var(--color_a_50)"})},children:(o,J)=>{i();var k=j("Patreon");m(o,k)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(s);var w=t(s,2),I=e(w),g=t(e(I),2),q=t(e(g));i(),a(g);var _=t(g,2),f=t(e(_));z(f,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_50)"});var R=e(f);L(R,{get data(){return F},size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_50)",inline:!0}),i(),a(f);var S=t(f,2),X=e(S);M(X,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_50)",inline:!0}),i(),a(S),i(),a(_);var $=t(_,2),A=t(e($));i(),a($),a(I),a(w);var y=t(w,2),D=e(y);Q(D,{}),a(y);var P=t(y,2),E=e(P);V(E,{children:(p,o)=>{ae(p,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(P),a(n),B((p,o)=>{x(q,"href",p),x(A,"href",o)},[()=>C("/about"),()=>C("/tree")]),m(v,n),Y()}export{fe as component};
