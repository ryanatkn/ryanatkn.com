I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you like my software and want to see more
				of it, a donation of any amount is helpful in two ways -- 1) because of the money, and 2)
				because it's a signal that boosts the case for me to get other sources of funding, like
				potentially a job or a grant. I'm open to joining an aligned organization that wants to
				sponsor part-time work on my open source project <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> and its dependencies. Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fti-__uwjazBllAqR73wrQ1lG6QO0ECBpz4n7XENP0Y/edit?usp=sharing">my resume</a>.</p> <p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it. I program both as a profession and hobby, and I love the web
				for its wide reach, high capability, backwards compatibility, and gatekeeper optionality. In
				2019 I started publishing almost all of my code as I wrote it, and set out to produce high
				quality and reusable software with TypeScript and Svelte, working full-time in public and
				continuing today. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>Today most of my time goes to my projects that face end-users, and some of their
				dependencies and extensions:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> - fullstack web toolkit</li> <li><a href="https://moss.ryanatkn.com/">Moss</a> - CSS framework and design system</li> <li><a href="https://www.fuz.dev/">Fuz</a> - Svelte UI library</li> <li><a href="https://gro.ryanatkn.com/">Gro</a> - task runner and toolkit extending SvelteKit</li> <li>more on <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">my GitHub profile</a> and <a href="https://www.ryanatkn.com/tree">here on my website</a></li></ul> <p>I'm communicating about my projects and process on YouTube with <a href="https://youtube.com/@webdevladder">@webdevladder</a> and blogging at <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/">webdevladder.net</a>. I wrote more about what I'm
				doing in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p> <p>I've been lucky to be able to live off savings for the last 6 years, but I need a funding
				plan to sustain these projects. My runway currently extends through 2026.</p> <p>To help me produce software, videos, and blog posts, you can support me on <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> or <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a>. Supporting me at any level grants you access to supporters-only social websites I build
				on camera (none yet, maybe late 2025). Supporting me through GitHub instead of Patreon also
				gives you access to discussions on a supporters-only GitHub repo.</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to collaborate more with people
				around these ideas and technologies.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function ie(m){var o=W(),l=e(o),d=e(l),c=e(d),f=t(e(c),2);k(f,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),a(c),a(d),a(l);var s=t(l,2),n=e(s);k(n,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var v=e(n);H(v,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",attrs:{style:"max-width: 100%"},icon:r=>{C(r,{data:G,fill:"var(--color_b_5)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(r,Y)=>{i();var x=j("GitHub Sponsors");u(r,x)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(n);var b=t(n,2);H(b,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:r=>{$(r,{fill:"var(--color_a_5)"})},children:(r,Y)=>{i();var x=j("Patreon");u(r,x)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(s);var w=t(s,2),z=e(w),_=t(e(z),4),T=t(e(_));B(T,"href",`${K??""}/about`),i(),a(_);var I=t(_,10),p=t(e(I));k(p,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var F=e(p);C(F,{data:G,size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_5)",inline:!0}),i(),a(p);var S=t(p,2),L=e(S);$(L,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_5)",inline:!0}),i(),a(S),i(),a(I),i(2),a(z),a(w);var g=t(w,2),M=e(g);N(M,{}),a(g);var P=t(g,2),E=e(P);O(E,{children:(y,r)=>{R(y,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(P),a(o),u(m,o)}export{ie as component};
