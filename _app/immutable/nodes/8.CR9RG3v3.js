				our intent and creativity. I'm driven by curiosity and wanting to improve our lives with
				technology.</p> <p>My software is <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">open source on GitHub</a> and this website's homepage lists my <a>ongoing projects</a>. I'm
				seeking <a>funding</a> to remain independent.</p> <p>I work on the web because for all its flaws, it's our best collectively-governed platform
				with backwards compatibility that runs everywhere, reaching more people with less friction
				than anything else. I care a lot about software quality, maintainability, performance, and
				providing power to users throughout the stack.</p></div> <p class="svelte-10efjxi">More:</p> <ul class="svelte-10efjxi"><li>in 2019 I started doing full-time open source, publishing <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">my code</a> for free with permissive licenses</li> <li>I was initially self-taught (ty internet ppl) and I've been working as a JS-oriented web dev
