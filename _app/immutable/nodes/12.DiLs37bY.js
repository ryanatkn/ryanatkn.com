I'm an independent software developer and this is an attempt to
				fund my work on free and open source software. If you enjoy my output and want more of it, a
				donation of any amount is helpful in two ways, 1) because money buys me time, and 2) because
				it's a strong signal that boosts my case for getting more funding, from both users like you
				and maybe grants or a job that sponsors some of my open source work.</p> <p>In 2011 I began my first job as a professional web developer focusing on JS, and many years
				later I'm still enjoying it. I program both as a profession and hobby, and I love the web
				for its global accessibility, high capability, backwards compatibility, and gatekeeper
				optionality. In 2019 I started publishing most of my code as I wrote it, and set out to
				produce high quality and reusable software with TypeScript and Svelte, working full-time in
				public and continuing today. More <a>about me</a>.</p> <p>My goal is to make the best software possible, and I believe sustaining this requires
				aligning ownership and incentives. To me this means it must be unburdened by investors and
				profit-seeking, and ultimately be community-owned and controlled like through a nonprofit.
				Since 2019 I've put my money where my mouth is, spending my savings to build an open source
				web software stack (it was self-directed time and I'll admit to having fun, but I think the
				results speak to productivity too). The foundations feel right, and I can dream about the
				stack succeeding to where I'm irrelevant.</p> <p>I like my independence and I think it serves the software well, but my current situation is
				not ideal. Having many smaller sponsors would free me from the influence of large sponsors,
				but I miss working on a team, having organizational support, and receiving a paycheck. Maybe
				collaborating with volunteers doing open source will satisfy, I don't know. I'm following
				multiple paths including grant funding, and I'm open to joining an organization that wants
				to see <a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> succeed as a noncommercial and independent software project. Right now I'm not looking for full-time
				work unless it's related to Zzz (for example I can build tools and websites with it (<small><em>with ai!! tell ur boss</em></small>)). Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fti-__uwjazBllAqR73wrQ1lG6QO0ECBpz4n7XENP0Y/edit?usp=sharing">my resume</a>.</p></div></section> <section class="box row flex_wrap gap_md"><div class="display_contents"><!></div> <!></section> <section class="panel p_sm shadow_md w_100"><div class="panel bg p_xl shadow_xs"><p>Today my attention is on these projects, and I plan to make end-user-facing websites and
				apps with them:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.zzz.software/">Zzz</a> - fullstack toolkit for adaptive web environments</li> <li><a href="https://moss.ryanatkn.com/">Moss</a> - CSS framework and design system</li> <li><a href="https://www.fuz.dev/">Fuz</a> - Svelte UI library</li> <li><a href="https://gro.ryanatkn.com/">Gro</a> - task runner and toolkit extending SvelteKit</li> <li>more on my <a href="https://github.com/ryanatkn">GitHub profile</a> and <a href="https://www.ryanatkn.com/tree">here</a> on my website</li></ul> <p>I'm communicating about my projects and process with <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/">webdevladder.net</a>. I shared more plans in the blog post <a href="https://www.webdevladder.net/blog/introducing-webdevladder">"Introducing Webdevladder"</a>.</p> <p>I've been lucky to be able to live off savings for the last 6 years, but I need a funding
				plan to sustain these projects. My runway currently extends through 2026.</p> <p>To help me produce software, videos, and blog posts, you can support me on <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn"><!> GitHub
					Sponsors</a> or <a class="white_space_nowrap" href="https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn"><!> Patreon</a>. Supporting me at any level grants you access to supporters-only social websites I build
				on camera (none yet, maybe late 2025). Supporting me through GitHub instead of Patreon
				grants access to a repo with supporters-only discussions.</p> <p>I hope to continue having fun building useful software, and to collaborate more with people
				around these ideas and technologies.</p></div></section> <section class="box gap_xl2"><!></section> <section class="box"><!></section></div>`);function de(v){var o=V(),r=e(o),d=e(r),c=e(d),w=t(e(c),2);x(w,"",{},{transform:"scaleX(-1)"}),a(c),a(d),a(r);var s=t(r,2),l=e(s),p=t(e(l),4),b=t(e(p));T(b,"href",`${N??""}/about`),i(),a(p),i(4),a(l),a(s);var g=t(s,2),m=e(g);x(m,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var B=e(m);G(B,{href:"https://github.com/sponsors/ryanatkn",attrs:{style:"max-width: 100%"},icon:n=>{H(n,{data:$,fill:"var(--color_b_5)",size:"var(--space_xl7, 64px)"})},children:(n,A)=>{i();var I=C("GitHub Sponsors");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(m);var F=t(m,2);G(F,{href:"https://www.patreon.com/ryanatkn",align:"right",icon:n=>{M(n,{fill:"var(--color_a_5)"})},children:(n,A)=>{i();var I=C("Patreon");f(n,I)},$$slots:{icon:!0,default:!0}}),a(g);var _=t(g,2),z=e(_),S=t(e(z),8),u=t(e(S));x(u,"",{},{"--link_color":"var(--color_b_5)"});var L=e(u);H(L,{data:$,size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_b_5)",inline:!0}),i(),a(u);var P=t(u,2),q=e(P);M(q,{size:"var(--font_size_md)",fill:"var(--color_a_5)",inline:!0}),i(),a(P),i(),a(S),i(2),a(z),a(_);var y=t(_,2),E=e(y);O(E,{}),a(y);var j=t(y,2),Z=e(j);U(Z,{children:(k,n)=>{W(k,{})},$$slots:{default:!0}}),a(j),a(o),f(v,o)}export{de as component};
